# Deployment guidelines

[QGIS Docs to publish plugin](https://plugins.qgis.org/publish/)

## Upload new plugin

1. Get an OSGEO ID from [here](https://www.osgeo.org/community/getting-started-osgeo/osgeo_userid/). This ID is needed to upload a new plugin/make changes to existing one. This is essentially how you login to QGIS Plugin Repository
2. Navigate to [QGIS Plugin Repository](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/). Use the upload button to upload the new plugin.
    - QGIS might reach out via email, or via a github issue, if there are any requirements missing. This is true for existing plugin as well. Do keep an eye out for that.
3. Once plugin has been uploaded, wait for approval. Someone will be assigned to your case.

## Update existing plugin
1. To update an existing plugin, navigate to [My Plugins][https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/my]. Select the plugin to update.
2. You can update an existing version by navigating to versions, and selecting the edit/delete button alongside the version. Date of update doesn't change, fyi.
1. You can add a new version by navigating to manage tab. Make sure to make changes to the changelog to let users know what was changed.
